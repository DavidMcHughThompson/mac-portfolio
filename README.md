# mac-portfolio

This repository serves as the holding place for the html pages and CSS code that make up my portfolio website.

The repository is not yet complete. It has the basic elements, but in time, I will go back and format the website so it looks much prettier.

To Do:

- Put all the text and pictures in alignment
- Pick a good color palette and apply it consistently across the website
- Format the links so they are side by side instead of on top of each other
- Add a search bar
- See if you can add a bar/header going across the top
