      <p>
        Hello! I'm David McHugh Thompson, but you can call me Mac. I've got a
        wide variety of interests, but there's a couple commonalities between
        them that ties them together. I enjoy things that force me to solve
        problems and improve myself to get better at them, and that give me a
        sense of fulfillment and purpose. For example, I love exercising, in
        particular weightlifting, biking and hiking. I enjoy how they make me
        push myself, and I enjoy the feeling of pride and accomplishment of
        overcoming a personal limitation and of exercising the abilities I've
        worked to develop.

      <p>
        In the same vein, I enjoy cooking and playing fighting games (Play Melee
        and Rev 2!). Both of those hobbies require discipline and practice to
        cultivate skill, as well as the ability to honestly and accurately
        reflect on one's shortcomings and weaknesses and make a deliberate
        effort to overcome them. Those problem solving skills; as well as the
        confidence in my ability to learn that those skills have granted me,
        have served me very well in my endavours to learn other difficult
        skills. My hobbies, studies, and natural disposition mean that I have
        several skills that make me a valuable addition to a team. I studied
        philosophy in college, and as a result, I am a good problem solver, a
        quick learner, and overall am quite intelligent and capable of
        articulating complex concepts. I communicate well with others, I am good
        at working with others in a team setting, and I am adept at distilling
        complex concepts down into their simplest components. I've spent some
        years in the foodservice industry before learning how to code, so I am
        adept at working hard and recognizing when something simply must be
        taken care of.
